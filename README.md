# LIRI-node-app

## Brief App description

LIRI-node-app allows users to pull up information about a song, a movie, or a concert using Spotify, BandsInTown APIs and OMDb APIs via the appropriate NPM modules. LIRI uses API calls and returned JSON objects, outputting the information in a specified format. 

## Technologies Used:
    Node.js
    JavaScript
    Spotify API (via spotify npm module)
    OMDb API (via Axios npm module)
    BandsInTown API (via Axios npm module)

## How to use the app
 Using inquirer, we simplified the search process by eliminating typing the command line suggested in instruction (ex: spotify-this song, movie-this, etc). Instead, users only need to put in "node liri" in the command line to start the queries which will bring them a prompt of what they are trying to look for.
